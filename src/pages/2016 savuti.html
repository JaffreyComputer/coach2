      <p class="para"><img src="@@webRoot/assets/images/leopard.jpg" alt="Leopard" width="300" height="200" class="img_right" />While one can never recapture the original experience of one's  &quot;first love &quot;' my return visit to my first safari destination, Botswana after a 19 year hiatus did not disappoint.  I was pleased to find that the wilderness remained pristine and that Wilderness Safaris had developed many of their camps in the Okavango  Delta according to their<em> &quot;<a href="www.wilderness-safaris.com/about/the-4cs.html"><strong>4Cs</strong></a>&quot;</em> doctrine, commerce, community, conservation, and culture.   Of the three camps, each situated in three distinct geographic areas of the delta, Savuti Camp best  epitomized the 4Cs.  Since my 1997  visit to Savuti and Chitabe,  in keeping with the demand, Wilderness has greatly upgraded the accommodations and food service, but more importantly Wilderness Safaris has continued to develop the the conservation, community and culture aspects of the 4Cs. </p>

      As of this last year, the Savute channel has begun to dry up. This wet/dry cycle  that occurs about every ten years requires that the animals who reside in this region adapt to the altered water flow.  Elephants, who dominate the Chobe/Linyanti area of the delta, begin to concentrate along the Chobe River where there is an abundant water source.  This not only places pressure on the water resources, but also the vegetation along the river.  To relieve this over grazing, Wilderness Safaris, in collaboration with the Botswana government, has agreed to maintain the Savuti pan(water hole) located in front of the main lodge.  The water is pumped into the pan on a timer and the clever elephants know when the &quot;faucet&quot; is turned on!      </p>

      <p class="para">From a camp management standpoint, Wilderness has continued to expand their commitment to solar energy and recycling in orders to reduce the lodges' impact on the delta. </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Community</strong><br />
        <strong><img src="@@webRoot/assets/images/dessert.jpg" alt="Dessert" width="300" height="200" class="img_right" /></strong>Wilderness' Internal Community or &quot;the Wilderness Tribe&quot; have evolved over the ensuing 19 years to include staff and guides from Botswana.  This employment and training of local residents creates a tremendous bond with the local communities who then benefit directly and have a vested interest in conservation of the delta.  Savuti's management team consisted of Mama Bee (relief manager), Sarita, and Elena. These ladies ran a tight ship, but the esprit de corps was always present.  When I casually mentioned that I liked their chili jam and had a recipe for jalape√±o lime ice cream, they immediately invited me to make the ice cream for dessert at dinner that night! </p>
      
      <p class="para">The real heart of any safari camp are the guides.  My colleague, Lynn, and I were privileged to have a fantastic guide, Goodman.  He definitely lived up to his name in every way.  From our first game drive, Goodman turned to us and said, &quot; I have read the newspaper today&quot;.  He would  proceed to then relate a few of the headlines ,but as any good reporter would do, he would then drive us to the scene of the &quot;crime.&quot;  On our first afternoon game drive the beat was the rotting Cape buffalo  carcass being devoured by flies.   During our three night stay,  our reporter's beat took us to the haunts of the leopard, lion, cheetah, elephant and  a sleep out in the bush. Lynn even  received a safari driver's lesson. </p>
      <p class="para"><img src="@@webRoot/assets/images/lyn-driver.jpg" alt="Lyn &amp; Driver" width="300" height="200" class="img_right" />The highlight of our stay was our &quot;cops and robbers&quot; chase in pursuit of the resident wild dog pack. Goodman's strategy was to &quot;follow the puppies and you'll  find the adults.&quot; This tactic paid off and we witnessed not only the spoils of the hunt, but the touching scene of the adults returning to feed the puppies regurgitated impala.  I invite you to view my little slideshow on &quot;a day in the life on safari at Savuti Camp&quot; beginning with my small aircraft flight from Victoria Falls to the Savuti airstrip to my departure for next camp, Tubu Tree, with elephant grazing in the airstrip bushes!</p>
