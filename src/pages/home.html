					Searching for the kind of vacation you want can be work rather than play. As a travel professional, I have years of experience navigating through the
					rough seas of our information age. Terra Nova's philosophy is if I do not know the answers to your travel inquiries from personal experience, I know
					where to find them.

				<h3 class="para">Travel Navigator</h3>
				<p class="para">
					As your Travel Navigator I am your compass, but you are still the captain of the ship. Whether it be sailing on the Star Clipper or trekking in Nepal,
					I am here to steer you on the course that is right for you. Even if your travels ultimately lead you in an unanticipated direction, remember that this
					too is part of the journey, the adventure, the enriching experience, for you, the inquisitive, independent and intrepid traveler. I now would like to
					extend to you a personal &quot;Invitation à Voyage&quot; through this site.
				</p>
				<p class="para">
					I custom design every trip. Locating an enchanted French village a la &quot;Chocolat&quot; or connecting you with textile artisans in Chile's Lake
					District region are the type of assignments I undertake. Travel arrangements are designed with your time constraints, budget and personal style in
					mind. For this very reason, you will notice that my site contains no prices or &quot;Specials of the Week&quot;. This intentional absence is intended
					to provoke dialogue and underscore the individual nature of each trip.
				</p>
				<p class="para">
					Another marked absence is a Europe page. While I welcome the opportunity to design more traditional vacations to the blockbuster cities of London,
					Paris, Barcelona, and Prague or the popular regions of Provence, Cote d'Azur, Tuscany, Andalusia and Catalonia, I have designed this site to expand
					your travel horizons.
