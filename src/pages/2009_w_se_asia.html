				<img src="2009_w_se_asia/image003.jpg" alt="Temple" width="300" height="512" class="img_right" />KarmaQuest is proud to offer a 17 day customized
				cultural tour of Laos and Vietnam, specially designed for Christina Wilson and friends. This is the fifth collaborative tour organized jointly by
				KarmaQuest, Christina and Terra Nova Travel. More than two years in planning, this one-of-a-kind travel experiences takes you on a journey into
				Southeast Asia’s most vibrant and well-preserved cultural landscapes, including two UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Luang Prabang and Halong Bay), to Hanoi
				with its French colonial charm and lingering history of arts and craftsmanship, and to picturesque northern Vietnam hillside ethnic villages around Sapa
				where ecotourism programs are working to better people’s lives in environmentally and culturally appropriate ways.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Interwoven with these cultural highlights are specially arranged visits to villages and centers where traditional weaving and hand-stitchery techniques
				are still practiced and promoted. We’ll learn about the region’s rich history of textiles from experts, and will see the colorful weavings being worn
				and sold in village bazaars as well as in boutique outlets where traditional patterns have been adapted to modern Western tastes.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Throughout the trip, we’ll travel by a variety of means, from floating on the Mekong River, to an overnight train ride to Sapa, to a night on a charming
				‘junk’ in Halong Bay. The trip is rated as moderately adventurous, requiring the ability to walk on well-maintained village trails on two 4 km/2.5 mile
				long day-hikes; and a sense of openness to different ways of life, with flexible expectations and patience. Travel in Southeast Asia is rich in both
				anticipated and unanticipated opportunities. Your safety and comfort is always our top priority.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Trip leadership is provided by Wendy Brewer Lama, owner of KarmaQuest Ecotourism and Adventure Travel, and Ecotourism Specialist. Wendy has worked for
				the past twenty years in Asia in community-based (eco)tourism development and has led numerous trips throughout Asia. Local sightseeing/tour guides will
				provide expertise from each country, and resource people will be invited to speak on special-interest topics. In keeping with KarmaQuest’s, Terra Nova
				Travel’s and Christina Wilson’s travel ethics, we’ll visit social service project sites where your purchases and donations will help support programs
				that benefit disadvantaged people, particularly women, and help to support cultural, environmental, and wildlife conservation. An (optional) group
				donation to a selected social service non-profit is encouraged.

			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_w_se_asia/image007.jpg" alt="Alms Giving" width="300" height="400" class="img_right" />Our four night stay in Luang Prabang gives ample
				time to take in the city sights and surroundings. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, Luang Prabang is an outstanding example of the
				fusion of traditional Laotian architecture and European colonial styles of the 19th and 20th centuries. As part of the UNESCO plan, new buildings have
				been limited and development must be in keeping with this magical place.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Rise early in the morning to join in the local custom of alms giving: when local people give alms to the Buddhist monks who carry bowls for the
				collection of their food as they walk through neighborhoods early in the morning. It is a belief that in order to gain merit before they start their
				daily life, people normally go to a Buddhist temple, or, they – and we -- can earn merit in this way.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				After witnessing the Alms Bowl giving on the streets, we will be transferred to a quiet monastery - the Wat Ba Pat nestled on the shores of the Mekong
				River. Here we can make an offering in the local tradition. Return to the hotel for breakfast.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				After breakfast, we will set out for Phone Say village. Hidden along the Mekong River, just a few kilometers from the Luang Prabang downtown, Phone Say
				appears to be one of the most intact traditional Lao villages in the area. Here most women weave textiles while men make fishing traps for fishing on
				the Mekong River. This charming village cannot be reached by vehicle but just half an hour walking from the main road brings us to another part of the
				world, with the rattling sound of weavers’ looms.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				We will stop at one of the most skillful lady weavers in this village, Ms. Ting, who inherited a hand-weaving skill from her mother 30 years ago. After
				visiting her workshop, we’ll enjoy a home-hosted lunch cooked by her younger sister Mrs. Bounkhong, who is teaching cooking at a college in Luang
				Prabang.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_w_se_asia/image009.jpg" alt="Temple" width="300" height="201" class="img_right" />Return to Luang Prabang. In the afternoon, we’ll set
				out to visit National Museum, the former Royal Palace which houses the collection of valuables, including the famous Prabang Buddha statue and gifts
				received from foreign dignitaries (the US gift is of a bit of moon rock). We’ll also visit Wat Visoun, the 16th century temple that served as a small
				museum for religious artifacts, and Wat Aham, the early 19th century temple whose two guardian figures at the foot of the steps represent two characters
				from the Ramayana – Hanuman, the Monkey God and a fierce Yaksa. We’ll visit Wat Xiengthong, the 16th century temple, which more than any other temple in
				Luang Prabang, epitomizes all the elegance and grace of Luang Prabang architecture.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Time permitting, we’ll visit the Traditional Arts &amp; Ethnology Centre (TAEC) - the first exhibition space and fair trade store dedicated to the
				collection, preservation, interpretation, and presentation of the traditional arts and lifestyles of Laos. We’ll end the day at Phousi Hill - climbing
				328 steps to the summit of Phousi Hill which dominates the sky-line of Luang Prabang providing the finest panoramic view in the whole city!

			</ul>
			<p class="sectionhdr">Day 7: Luang Prabang Feb 8 (Sunday)</p>
			<p class="para">
				After breakfast, we’ll take a morning drive (15 km/10 mi) outside of Luang Prabang to the Elephant Park Project, located on the banks of the Nam Khan
				River. Xieng Lom was established in 2003 to protect the Asian elephants in Laos. As the forests disappear, the elephants which used to help with logging
				can become neglected. The camp’s aim is to give these elephants a brighter future. So far six elephants have been freed from logging work and given a
				new home in the park. Experienced mahouts (elephant keepers) and vets help the elephants adapt to their new environment.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_w_se_asia/image011.jpg" alt="Elephant ride" width="240" height="160" class="img_right" />This project brings the elephants a more
				comfortable retirement by providing professional medical care, nutritious food, caring staff, and a natural environment. It also provides jobs to local
				people and supports the community, as well as helping support rural development in Luang Prabang. Most importantly, the project provides both
				communities and local businesses with an example of sustainable tourism and how to successfully link conservation with tourism.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				As well as protecting the Asian elephant, all tours benefit the communities in the area. Guides, cooks, mahouts and maintenance staff at the Elephant
				Park come from the surrounding villages. The Elephant Park has also funded construction of the community's water supply. Profits from the project also
				help fund nearby Xieng Lom School. In the future, the Project plans to convert elephant dung into biogas, fertilizer and even paper.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_w_se_asia/image013.jpg" alt="Wash day" width="300" height="230" class="img_right" />Afterward, we’ll continue to drive (125 km/ 78 mi) to
				visit Ban Nanyang village, inhabited by the Lu people, a minority tribal people originally from Yunnan, China dating back to the late 18th century.
				We’ll walk (on an easy trail) to the village of 500 inhabitants where they grow their own cotton for weaving. Each household has 2-3 weaving looms
				underneath the stilt house. This Lu village has its own weaving style, of which they make special table cloths, wall hangings, scarves, etc. We will
				spend a few hours here visiting from home to home and interacting with local people about their traditions and effort to preserve the traditional craft
				over the generations.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				We’ll return to Luang Prabang, and this evening, will enjoy a Barci ceremony at Heritage House. This special ceremony also called Soukhouane is one of
				the most charming ceremonies in Laos, usually held during Lao New Year festival, but also at any auspicious time, such as for those who will take a long
				journey or have just returned, and especially for welcoming guests. This is for blessing for good health and happiness.

				CAMACrafts is a non-profit, self-help project that markets handicrafts made by Lao artisans. Products are entirely handmade using traditional patterns
				and techniques, such as appliqué, cross stitch, embroidery and batik. This work provides employment for more than 250 women, an estimated 70% of whom
				are the only cash earners for their families. Money earned from the handicrafts is largely used to send their children to school, and to provide food
				and medicine for their family.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Tum Tum Cheng Lao Food Restaurant and Cooking School in Luang Prabang gets its name from the early morning sounds of drums and cymbals played by the
				monks at the nearby Xieng Thong Temple. The cooking school has been open since 2001, and focuses on traditional Lao recipes as well as Lao fusion
				dishes.
