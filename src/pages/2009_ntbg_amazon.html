			<h3>TRIP OVERVIEW</h3>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_amazon/image009.jpg" alt="Sunset" width="300" height="225" class="img_right" />This exciting journey for adventurers begins with an
				overnight stay at the Tropical Manaus Hotel, followed the next day by a morning tour of Manaus. From there, the group will board the ship, Victoria
				Amazonica, where we will spend the next eight nights.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				We will depart from the pier of the Hotel Tropical on the Rio Negro in Manaus. At that place the river is six miles wide although over one thousand
				miles inland. The trip will focus mainly on the beautiful Rio Negro with its black water. June is high water time so we will be able to make many canoe
				excursions into the tops of the trees of the floodplain forest.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				The Rio Negro has many positives. It is beautiful with the mirror-like reflections in the water, but because it is very acid water there are no
				mosquitoes there and it is safe to swim in. We will also visit some of the small villages and towns along the river to learn about local life. Two days
				of the trip will be in the completely different ecosystem, that of the main Amazon River which has muddy water the colour of white coffee. Here we will
				see many birds and also be able to fish for piranha and other fish, but there will be a few mosquitoes. However the boat takes care to anchor away from
				the insects as far as possible.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_amazon/image005.jpg" alt="Canoe expedition" width="300" height="189" class="img_right" />The high waters of June also diminish the number
				of insects. By visiting the two different rivers, one with black water and the other with white water, we will be able to see a huge variety of Amazon
				life. Iain Prance will tell you all about the plants and Anne will identify the birds and tell you about the people, and boat Captain Moacir Fortes is
				full of local knowledge, natural history and legends. The crew takes good care of you throughout the trip and you will enjoy many Amazonian foods,
				especially from the fish we catch.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Each day we make at least two excursions, some by large stable canoes and some on land in the forest or at villages. We tend to make an early morning
				excursion, come back on board during the heat of the day and then another in the late afternoon or even at night to watch the caiman and other nocturnal
				life.

			<h3 class="leadin">SHIP DESCRIPTION: Victoria Amazonica</h3>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_amazon/image001.jpg" alt="Victoria Amazonica" width="300" height="166" class="img_right" />The Victoria Amazonica is a small 100 foot
				motorized vessel with 12 cabins that can accommodate up to 24 passengers plus crew. While not a luxury yacht, all cabins are air conditioned and have a
				private bathroom with a shower en suite. Please note that each cabin has a lower and UPPER bunk bed only. The dimension of the upper bed is 1.95 metres
				(6ft 4in) long and 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) wide. The lower bed is 1.95 metres long and 1.10 metres (3ft 7in) wide. The ship also has a Restaurant where

			</p>
			<p class="para">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="para">
				<img src="2009_amazon/image007.jpg" alt="Victoria Amazonica cabin" width="300" height="200" class="img_right" />Modern navigation equipment such as
				Global Positioning Systems, and satellite telephones, enable the crew to contact their home base with the ship’s location at all times. Should they
				encounter a situation that might require assistance, engine parts, or transportation of clients to or from Manaus, they have an experienced bush pilot
				and float-plane standing by to provide whatever service is required.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				The crew are professional, licensed mariners and our chefs are superb. Each boat driver brings along with them two kits. One with first aid medications
				and the other with motor tools in case the outboard motor breaks. The crew members are trained for simple medical emergencies. The “canoes” are 24 foot
				boats with outboard motors crewed by experienced guides for your daily trips into the interior. The crew are all river people, Coboclos, who are
				accustomed to the ways of the rainforest.
