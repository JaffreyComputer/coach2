      <p class="para">Having recently returned from experiencing first hand a Karisia walking safari, our escort, Nancy Pole-Wilhite, immediately wanted to share her adventure with a small group of intrepid women.<strong> </strong>Mango has woven into this tour not only a walking safari but also a <strong><em>traditional</em></strong> safari to some of the most interesting locations in Kenya. With a few days on North Kenya&rsquo;s Laikipia Plateau in a private conservancy, three days on a camel assisted walking safari led by Samburu warriors and a finale in the Masai Mara where the huge herds of the great wildebeest migration will be located, this trip offers a unique and amazing safari experience for the first time visitor and veteran safari goer.<strong> </strong></p>
