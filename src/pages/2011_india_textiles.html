        present another <strong>KarmaQuest trip </strong>specially designed for<strong> Christina
          Wilson</strong> and friends. This trip takes us to some of India’s oldest
        and most renowned <strong>centers of textile production and artistry</strong> where
        we’ll see ancient techniques of creating and decorating fabrics that
        still hold an important place in Indian society today. We’ll hear from
        masters of these ancient arts, watch as skilled craftsmen and women create <strong>museum-quality
          handicrafts</strong>. </p>
      <p class="para">We’ll visit <strong>premier religious and cultural sites</strong> with
        priceless 2000 year old Buddhist statues and art, and of course the famous <strong>Taj
          Mahal</strong> in Agra before trip’s end. In the historic and thriving
        urban centers of <strong>Mumbai and Delhi</strong>, we’ll tour not only
        the sightseeing ‘must sees’ but lesser known favorites that reveal the
        unique rhythms of life on India’s streets today. In smaller towns, we’ll
        have time to <strong>roam the bazaars and meet local artisans</strong> whose
        wares will surely tempt our pocket-books. In Rajasthan, we’ll <strong>live
          like <em>maharanis</em> in restored 18th* century palaces</strong>, dining
        in exquisite North Indian cuisine, indulging in <em>ayurvedic</em> spa
        treatments and gracious Indian hospitality. The itinerary is paced at
        an <strong>unhurried tempo </strong>and planned to allow you to opt out
        of scheduled activities from time to time and spend time as you wish.</p>
