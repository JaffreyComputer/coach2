				with Tibetan Buddhism numerology. Numerology of the West was already a part of my psyche, especially in relationship to the numerology of the Catholic
				Church-multiples of the Trinity. In my Footprint Tibet Handbook by the Tibetan author, Gyurme Dorje, I stumbled upon the Glossary. The etymology of
				words and numerology reveal the soul of a culture. Buddhism has no less than three synonyms for temple-stupa, chorten and chaitya. The number eight
				figures prominently in the Buddhist consciousness:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>8 Attributes of Pure Water (coolness, sweetness, lightness, softness, clearness, soothing quality, pleasantness and wholesomeness)</li>
				<li>8 Auspicious Symbols Tashi Tagye (umbrella, fish, conch, eternal knot, vase, wheel, flower and victory banner)</li>
				<li>
					8 Chorten (Stupas or Chaitya) symbolizing the Major Events of Buddha’s Life (birth, subjugation of Mara, enlightenment, teaching, descent from Tusita
					- after teaching his late mother, victory, revelation of miracles and decease.
				</li>
				<li>8 Taras who Protect From Fear A group of female divinities, who offer protection from 8 specific types of fear.</li>
			</ul>

				Wilson’s most recent trip seven women accompanied her to Nepal and Tibet, two of the great Himalayan countries. Christina, who I dubbed “the rainmaker”,
				had assembled a diverse group of seven women, a sculptress, a homemaker, a once upon a time theatre directress, a computer saleswoman, a pastry baker, a
				para-legal and a jewelry maker. Although some members knew each other, their only one common connection was Christina. Two women marked the passage of
				their half century on the trip.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Having trekked a half dozen times in Nepal, Christina selected a less frequented area in the foothills near Pokara, Panchasi Lekh. The five day trek
				followed a ridge above Phewa Tal (a large lake) with a sweeping view of the Annapurna range (snowy peaks at elevations of 22-25,000). While without the
				complications of high altitude hiking, the trek did present its own challenges-muddy trails, leeches and some steep descents. On the final night the
				intrepid trekkers’ reward was their home stay in the Gorkha village of Sirubari during the height of the Hindu festival, Dasain.

			<p class="para">
				Converging in Kathmandu the eight (Gye) and I, the travel agent, and the ninth member (Gu), all continued on together to Tibet. In Tibet we encountered
				not only the physical demands of a high altitude environment, but also those of a completely foreign culture and people. Barred to individuals without
				special connections, travel into Tibet requires that visitors travel with a group. The current minimum requirement is five tour members. It is possible
				to organize one's own group or join one with a &quot;set departure&quot; which should be prearranged prior to travel.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				In Lhasa, we discovered the “formal” Tibet at the Potala Palace, the official home of the Dalai Lama, but Tibet’s heart is the famous square, the
				Barkhor, and its soul is the Jokhang Temple. We obtained unique glimpses of daily life at a Buddhist nunnery and a local carpet factory owned by our
				tour escort’s family. For the next three days we made our pilgrimage from Lhasa, on a bumpy, dusty road trip visiting the monasteries of Drepung on the
				outskirts of Lhasa, Tashilhunpo, home of the Panchen Lama in Shigatse and the fortress style Phalkor in Gyantse with the Nepalese style Kumbum Chorten.
				We literally dropped down into Lhasa over the Karola pass (about 17,000 ft), wending our way on serpentine roads. At the Karola pass, as a thanksgiving
				offering to the supreme beings we proudly hoisted our prayer flags a la Tibetan style.

				<img src="images/nepal_doma_pdx.jpg" alt="Doma" width="200" height="216" class="img_right" />But then there were ten… our guide, Doma. As a Tibetan, she
				and most of her family now reside in Nepal and the USA. Doma is about 5’1” in height with long black hair, a “moon” face with a mole, centered on her
				forehead that resembles a permanent tika. Like her famous countryman, the Dalai Lama, Doma, appears to be forever smiling. Although she is not dancer
				thin, she has a dancer’s sense of her body. Her movements are graceful and flowing. In Tibetan, her name, Doma, signifies Tara, the Goddess of
				Compassion. Doma immediately became one of us. She lead us through fields of leeches, bouts of altitude sickness, but most of all she gave us a better
				understanding of the “ INSCRUTIBLE EAST” through her ability to help our Western eyes “see” her rich cultural and spiritual heritage.
			</p>

				No adventure is complete without one that challenges the palate. Here are two of the delectable dishes Doma made for the 50th birthday party for one of
				our little band she hosted at her Kathmandu home.<br />
