				Terra Nova Travel is the reservation agent for the <a href="http://www.apakabarvillas.com/" target="_blank">Apa Kabar Villas</a> located in Amed, on the
				east coast of Bali, Indonesia. The twin villas are the perfect off-the-beaten path, vacation destination for couples, families and friends who want to
				experience the relaxed Balinese lifestyle. Private tours of the island can be arranged, from visiting temples, batik, gamelan artisans to simply
				&quot;hanging-out with natives&quot;.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				The surrounding area is famous for its aquatic activities such as snorkeling, diving and boating. After exploring the environs, no trip to Bali would be
				complete without visiting the island's cultural center, Ubud. For an interesting contrast, the Indonesian destinations of Yogjakarta or Lombok can also
				round out your Balinese vacation.
