				>From Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, it is about a three hour scenic drive through the bucolic countryside to the PNV, home to ten habituated mountain
				gorilla families and a troupe of golden monkeys, set in the stunning backdrop of the Visoke and Karisimbi volcanoes. At the park’s headquarters, the 80
				gorilla park permit holders are divided into ten groups of eight people. According to the location of the ten gorilla families, these ten homo sapiens
				groups are segregated according to a short ( 1-3 hour), medium ( 4-5 hour) or long (up to an entire day) hike. Although special trackers monitor the
				gorillas’ locations, the families can move from the last sighting which the trackers report around 8 am to the park officials. Accompanied by their
				guides, all gorilla trekkers converge on the park headquarters around 9:00 am to await their assignment to a gorilla family. While the guides are
				wheeling and dealing on their clients’ behalf, a local dance troupe performing the traditional Ugandan dances accompanied by live music entertains the
				excited trekkers. The Intore dance, translated as the “Dance of the Heroes” or “Chosen Ones”, was originally performed for the royal court which is now
				the 21st century tourists madly shooting photos and videos of the warriors in their raffia manes gyrating to the drums’ beat. Anticipating a three hour
				return drive back to Kigali on the day of my gorilla trek, I did the short trek to visit the Amamoro (Peace) family of about 18 members, including an 8
				week old baby!<br />

				>Unquestionably, the mountain gorillas and golden monkeys are the major attractions, but there are also wonderful excursions to local villages, and
				hikes with panoramic views of Lakes Ruhondo and Bulera. Aficionados of Dian Fossey can also arrange a day hike to her grave site. While the road from
				Kigali to the PNV is good by African standards, Rwanda is NOT a self -drive destination. A driver/guide is worth their weight in gold (or USD)!!! The
				road to the Dian Fossey trailhead was the worst of my entire 2800 km road trip throughout both Uganda and Rwanda!<br />
				<br />
				My little <a href="2012_uganda_primates_show.html">slideshow</a> is representative of the mountain gorilla viewing and surrounding Ugandan and Rwandan
				terrain. The show commences with Uganda’s <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/682" target="_blank">Impenetrable Forest</a> which features my trekking
				experience with the Mubare gorilla family and ends with a view of Lake Ruhondo from the Virunga Lodge. I hope this slideshow compels you to want
				personally experience the exhilaration of being in the physical presence of our amazing primate cousins! Call or email Nancy Pole-Wilhite for more
				details.<br />
