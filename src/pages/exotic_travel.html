			<h2>Exotic Travel</h2>
			<p class="para">
				As a 10 year old child I remember stumbling across a fascinating National Geographic article on Angkor Wat . I became intrigued with this mysterious
				monkey inhabited ancient temple city.I am ashamed to admit that Angor Wat still remains on my &quot;To Visit List&quot;, but I have had the vicarious
				pleasure of sending numerous clients to visit this relatively recently opened WorldHeritage Site.With the entire world as my &quot;canvas&quot;, I have
				concentrated on afew select destinations. With the exception of Bali, I havevisited Belize, Botswana and Chile within the lastfive years.As I continue
				to expand my horizons, I will addmy travel impressionsto these pages.

			<h3 class="para"><a href="botswana.html">Botswana</a> - Africa</h3>
			<p class="para">
				Like Cambodia, anotheronce upon a time &quot;off limits destination&quot;, South Africa, has only begun to experience the influx of American travelers
				within the last decade. As the gateway to Southern Africa, South Africa, a wonderfuldiverse country inits own right,is alsothe ideal departure point for
				visitingthe off shore paradiseislands of Mauritius and Madagascar and itsnorthern neighbors, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe.<a href="botswana.html"
					>Botswana</a
				>
				the Okavango Delta, one of the most unique topographies whichis transformedeveryfallwith the arrival of the annual flood.

			<h3 class="para"><a href="bali.html">Bali</a> - Indonesia</h3>
			<p class="para">
				<a href="et_bali.html">Bali</a>, one of the islands inthe archipelago of Indonesia, truly has it all - unspoilt beaches,sacred temples, undulating
				verdant terraces and a vibrant culture. Despite the political turmoil of East Timor and the capital, Jakarta, Bali is peaceful and remains above the
				strife. Reflecting this serenity is the &quot;off the beaten path&quot;Apakabar Villas,located on Bali's East Coast in Amed. I am pleased to be the
				reservations agent for the three American owners fell in love with the island and its people. You too, can experience the languous life style which Bali
				has become synonymous.

			<h3 class="para"><a href="chile.html">Chile</a> - South America</h3>
			<p class="para">
				Since 1995 I have collaborated with Tim Purvis who owns <a href="http://www.andeananglers.com/" target="_blank">Andean Anglers</a>, a fly-fishing tour
				company. Over the years I have made the travel arrangements for Tim's clients, not only to and from the Estancias and Lodges' rendezvous points, but
				also any desired auxiliary travel arrangements throughout <a href="chile.html">Chile</a>, Argentina and South America in general. These arrangements can
				be as straightforward as the airfare to and from your home town to the requisite lodge airport, to a week spent on a private tour in the Lake District
				visiting local textile artisans, to a five day excursion exploring the Torres del Paine National
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Further afield I have designed excursions to Machu Picchu, the Galapagos Islands, and Iguaçu Falls to name just a few popular pre/post fishing
				destinations. Naturally, you do not need to be on a fly fishing trip to discover Chile or the other wonders that Latin American offers.
			</p>
			<h3 class="para"><a href="peru.html">Peru</a> - South America</h3>
			<p class="para">
				Peru is still as alluring as ever. I can design a trip of the life time not only to the highlands but to arid coast and steamy jungles. For an
				impression of my most recent visit, click <a href="peru.html">here</a>.....
			</p>
			<h3 class="para"><a href="belize.html">Belize</a> - Central America</h3>
			<p class="para">
				Once known as British Honduras, <a href="belize.html">Belize</a> in pre-Columbian times was part of the mighty Mayan empire. In the 21st century,
				uncommercialized environments are a rarity. Belize, situated on the Gulf of Mexico and to the east of Guatemala, offers both the jungle and the beach.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				Belize's cayes are renowned for outstanding snorkeling and diving in pristine waters. Its jungles contain some of the richest examples of hardwood trees
				and medicinal plants as well as being home to thousands of varieties of butterflies, birds and amphibians.
			</p>
			<p class="para">This is an excellent alternative to Hawaii, Costa Rica or even Mexico for those seeking an exotic yet accessible vacation.<br /></p>
