        <strong><em>January 19 to February 8, 2013</em></strong></h2>
      <p class="para"><strong><img src="images/clip_image005.gif" alt="" width="188" height="143" hspace="12" align="left" class="img_right" />Terra Nova Travel </strong>is pleased to present another <strong>KarmaQuest trip </strong>specially designed for<strong> Christina Wilson</strong> and friends. Please join<strong> Christina </strong>and <strong>Wendy Brewer Lama</strong>, Director and Ecotourism Specialist of <strong>KarmaQuest Ecotourism and Adventure Travel</strong> on this third in a series of women&rsquo;s trips to Asia&rsquo;s centers of hand-produced textiles and centuries-old bazaars.</p>
      <p class="para">With a small group of women textile arts and crafts enthusiasts, we&rsquo;ll venture off the beaten track to <strong>village settings</strong> and <strong>artisan workshops</strong> to learn about Burma&rsquo;s age-old methods of hand-loom, silk and lotus root weaving <strong>with arts and crafts experts</strong>.  We&rsquo;ll attend quiet monasteries, tour magnificent ancient capital and temple sites – crowned as <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</strong> – and travel by air, ground and water to see the colorful and undiscovered cultural landscapes of Burma.</p>
      <p class="para"><img src="images/clip_image007.gif" alt="" width="202" height="153" hspace="12" align="right" class="img_right" />South East Asian textiles are known for their beauty and intricacy. <strong>Design and production methods in Burma have been influenced by over 2000 years of cultural and trade relationships</strong> with neighboring India and South East Asian countries. Traditionally, these intricate textiles have been made on a back-tension (back strap) loom with homegrown cotton, flax or hemp, often dyed with indigo or other locally produced natural dyes. They served as clothing and badges of identity and status -- cultural markers that are little known to the outside world. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="para">Weaving as a cottage industry plays an important part in the economy and life of many Burmese and ethnic families. Our attention to the textiles and their producers brings not only pleasure to us but encourages and gives status to the weavers who uphold these traditions.  In the tradition of past women&rsquo;s trips, we&rsquo;ll research and select a worthy <strong>Social Service Project </strong>to visit and support through our donations, purchases and contacts. <br />

        Travel conditions in Burma have improved remarkably in recent years. Airport facilities, roads and air service, hotels and sightseeing venues in the main tourist sites are now approaching standards found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. </p>
      <p class="para">We have selected generally three and four star standard hotel accommodations to provide you a very comfortable environment that reflects Burma&rsquo;s unique culture flavour as well as for their varied and optimal locations. Occasionally, due to circumstances beyond our control, the selected hotel or the preferred room standard is not available.  Every effort will be made to provide the utmost level of comfort and satisfaction at all times. </p>
      <p class="para">Some textile and crafts-production sites require overland travel in rural settings, where road conditions are generally good but always subject to construction or other interruptions. Boat travel is on safe and comfortable watercraft; for example, the photo above shows the type of boat used for a short ride to Wanpo village on day 15; the boat plying from Sittwe to Mrauk U is operated by the Mrauk U Princess Resort. </p>
      <p class="para">None-the-less, Burma is very much a developing country with a young tourism industry. Service staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating, and will surely capture your heart. Travelers will be pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort afforded while maintaining a spirit of adventure and readiness for unanticipated opportunities and change of plans. Our follow-up pre-departure information will provide additional tips for traveling, packing, and knowing what to expect.</p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Misc</strong><br />
        In general the check-in and check-out times at all hotels, unless otherwise stated in this itinerary, is between 1200 noon and 1400 hours. Whenever possible, we will arrange for suitable locations for rest and respite should flight schedules and the itinerary require otherwise. </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Social Service Project</strong><br />
        In keeping with the tradition of supporting social service programs in the countries we visit, this trip will feature the opportunity for trip members to visit and contribute to a yet-to-be-identified program that benefits cultural conservation, education or livelihood improvement in Burma.  Donations are optional and may include delivery of needed items (such as eye glasses for women weavers in Laos, Vietnam and India, as in past trips) and/or cash donations during or after the trip.  Stay tuned for more information.  </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Travelling in Burma</strong><br />
        <strong><em>What to call it? </em></strong><br />
        The ruling military junta changed the country&rsquo;s name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989. The United Nations recognizes the change, but the US and UK do not. A statement by the British Foreign Office says: &quot;Burma's democracy movement prefers the form 'Burma' because they do not accept the legitimacy of the unelected military regime to change the official name of the country. Internationally, both names are recognized.&quot; For more discussion, please see this<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7013943.stm" target="_blank"> BBC report</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Burma" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
      <p class="para"><strong><em>The ethics of traveling to Burma</em></strong><br />
        Over the past fifteen years, travelers have debated the ethics of visiting Burma.  Some have boycotted travel to Burma, suggesting that tourism unduly benefits the military government and its cronies. Others see the value of bringing tourism-related jobs to local populations and enabling two-way communications with the outside world.  </p>
      <p class="para">Recently, the National League for Democracy (NLD), Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s party which supports restoration of democracy and human rights in Burma, issued a <a href="http://www.nldburma.org/media-press-release/press-release/316-nld-statement-no-100511-released-on-20th-may-2011-regarding-tourism-in-burma-.html" target="_blank">public statement</a> that &ldquo;visitors were once again welcome – so long as they eschewed large-scale package tours in favor of gaining &lsquo;an insight into the cultural, political and social life of the country while enjoying a happy and fulfilling holiday in Burma&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="para">KarmaQuest&rsquo;s long standing commitment to the ethics of ecotourism supports the generation of equitable economic and educational opportunities to local populations, as well as conservation of the natural environment and cultural heritage of places we visit. In Burma, we select in-country travel partners and hotels that are not affiliated with the government, military or associates of either.  Furthermore, on this trip, by visiting villages and families that produce textiles, arts and craft, we&rsquo;ll &ldquo;encourage the preservation of time honored techniques and designs while stimulating innovation and experiment,&rdquo; spawning economic as well as cultural and artistic benefits (NLD <br clear="all" />

      <p class="para">website: ibid).  We welcome your ideas and sources of discussion material on this subject. We will provide a reading list and suggested informational websites in our forthcoming pre-departure information packet, provided at the time of trip sign-up.</p>
      <p class="para"><strong><em>Travel Security </em></strong><br />
        Each year, thousands of U.S. citizens travel to Burma for tourism, to visit family, and for other reasons. The U.S. Department of State has no travel warnings for Burma. Crime rates are lower in Burma than in many other countries in the region. Violent crime against foreigners is rare.</p>
      <p class="para">Burma&rsquo;s political climate occasionally erupts into localized conflicts between the government and ethnic minority groups along the country&rsquo;s border regions. We will closely follow media reports and public information about the security situation in Burma before and during our travels. Additional information regarding wise travel practices in Burma will be included in the Pre-Departure Information packet, distributed when you book the trip. </p>
      <p class="para">Please see the following website for additional information. <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1077.html" target="_blank">http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1077.html</a></p>
      <p class="para">Regarding health safety:  medical facilities and personnel training in Burma are inadequate.  We require that you have medevac insurance in case you need to be transported to a regional medical center outside of Burma for emergency care. We will provide additional information on medevac insurance once you sign up for the trip. We will also provide information on vaccinations and other health precautions via the CDC website. </p>
      <p class="para">Having traveled to Burma several times in the past decade, Christina Wilson and Wendy Lama convey a sense of ease and confidence about returning to one of their favorite Asian destinations.  Wendy remains in contact with diplomatic friends who work and travel there frequently; in fact, we hope to meet some fascinating Burmese artists and newsmakers through those associations. </p>

        Christina has been interested in traveling her entire life. In 1982 she took her first trip to Nepal and India. Since then, she has been going to every exotic place she can find in the world. Her goal is to visit all the interesting places including her own back yard during her lifetime. </p>
      <p class="para">Christina worked with Outward Bound for many years and it was there, putting women&rsquo;s trips together, that she found her passion. Outward Bound taught her that it was the journey, not the destination that was important; and about the importance of giving back to the community that she visits. The trips she puts together always include a service project or a contribution to a local organization. </p>
      <p class="para">Christina has led many trips all over the world. Her trips are usually small so that the group travels intimately and easily. For the last twenty years she has led many groups to interesting places, including Peru. Bolivia, Ecuador, Italy, England, Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, Burma, Micronesia, Bali, and Indonesia, to name a few.&nbsp; Her most recent&nbsp;trips, operated by KarmaQuest,&nbsp;are with a small group&nbsp;of women&nbsp;who toured&nbsp;Laos and Vietnam in&nbsp;February 2009, and India in January 2011. Christina&nbsp;is a National Tropical Botanical Gardens member and is currently on the Board of Trustees. She&nbsp;led&nbsp;her third trip for NTBG in November 2008 to Madagascar and South Africa&nbsp;and has&nbsp;recently returned from the NTBG-sponsored Amazon cruise&nbsp;led by NTBG&nbsp;Fellow and former head of Kew Gardens, Sir Ghilliean Prance.</p>
