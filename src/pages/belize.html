									The 21st century buzz word, globalization, is not a new concept. Nationalism with its accompanying borders, the 20th century buzz word, is
									passé... The countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras knew no 20th century borders during the heyday of the Mayas. As early as
									600BC the Mayan Empire began to spread throughout what we now call Central America. Only in the last century has the &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot;
									of Mayan hieroglyphics permitted scholarly translations of many archeological remains. The most recent, the Temple stairs hieroglyphicsof Dos
									Pilas, located near Tikal, was recentlyrevealed in the aftermath of the 2001 hurricane season.

									In the heart of the former Mayan Empire, Belize, has within its own borders,a number of interesting minor Mayan ruins. Although located in
									Guatemala, the most impressive and largest of all Mayan sites, Tikal, is actually closer to the Belizean border than to Guatemala's capital.
									For this very reason, Chaa Creek, an eco lodge situated only 2 hours by road from Tikal is an excellent location for both a jungle and
									archeological experience. As part of their Inland Expeditions tour series, guests can arrange in advance or on the spot a full day excursion
									to Tikal including transportation, entry fee, monument guide and lunch.

									Garnering the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) Environmental Award for 2001, Chaa Creek is striving to preserve the native habitat. In
									the early 1980's Mick and Lucy Fleming ( a Brit and an American) purchasedacreage west of San Ignacio. In the ensuing years they have
									transformed their property into a premier eco lodge. The accommodations are the traditional Mayan style which remains thedesign of choice in
									contemporary villages.
								</p>
								<p class="para">
									Utilizing ancientmaterialseachcottage is constructed with white washed adobe blocks. The roof is thatched from the locally grown cohune (bay
									leaf)palm leaves. The Flemings are investigating ways to grow this endangered palm and thus maintain the traditionalthatching supply. Each
									cottage's electricity is generated from a central source. Although Chaa Creek isstriving for authenticity, its guests are relieved to find
									that proper beds with comfy mattresses have replaced traditional hammocks and that en suite bathrooms complete with sinks, showers and flush
									toilets have replaced the outhouse. All rooms are tastefully decorated with colorful Mayan textiles and Spanish influenced wood furniture, all
									hand crafted in neighboring Guatemala. Each cottage'sveranda is equipped with a hammock and the &quot;regulation&quot; lime green gecko. The
									grounds are predominatelylandscaped with native species, but humble zinnias are interspersed amongst the exotic heliconia.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the years Mick and Lucy have slowly &quot;developed&quot; the property. Catering to the outdoor set, they offer more rustic
									accommodations at the Macal River Camp which is popular site for launching canoe trips.Hiking/mountain biketrails galore wend throughout the
									property.From Chaa Creek, an equestrian trail leads tothe popular Cahal PechMayan ruin circuit. Nature lovers will enjoy the crack of dawn
									bird watchingwalksor hiking up the hill to the Natural History Centre and the Butterfly Farm. The farm has a fascinating display on the life
									cycle of the morpho butterfly. These iridescent blue butterflies are raised here for export to United States and other countries. For the
									weary bodies, Chaa Creek's latest addition,the spa on Butterfly Hill, offers state of the art facilities with a panoramic view of the
									surrounding rain forest.,
								</p>
								<p>
									In the grand scheme, Mick and Lucy want to recreate a working Mayan settlement where local farmers and their families can live and work the
									land as their ancestors have done for over a 1000 years. The Flemings are dedicated to preserving not only endangered species, but also
									endangered cultures.

									guests are asked bring a bathing suit and aqua or tennis shoes for the cave swimming/fording that is part of the cave exploration. Pine Ridge
									is aptly named for its pine forests and a deviation to Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Blancaneaux&quot; Lodge is anincongruous diversion in this

									The allure of the Belizeantropical reefs frequently overshadows Belize's interior, but the visitor should not overlook this fascinating area
									and its rich heritage. The perfect combination for any vacation to Belize should include both the jungle and the beach!
