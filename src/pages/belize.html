									The 21st century buzz word, globalization, is not a new concept.&nbsp; Nationalism with its accompanying borders, the 20th century buzz word,
									is passé...&nbsp; The countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras knew no 20th century borders during the heyday of the Mayas.&nbsp;
									As early as 600BC the Mayan Empire began to spread throughout what we now &nbsp;call Central America.&nbsp; Only in the last century has the
									&quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; of Mayan hieroglyphics permitted scholarly translations of many archeological remains.&nbsp; The most recent, the
									Temple stairs hieroglyphics&nbsp;of Dos Pilas, located near Tikal, was recently&nbsp;revealed in the aftermath of the 2001 hurricane season.

									In the heart of the former Mayan Empire, Belize, has within its own borders,&nbsp;a number of interesting minor Mayan ruins.&nbsp; Although
									located in Guatemala, the most impressive and largest of all Mayan sites, Tikal, is actually closer to the Belizean border than to Guatemala's
									capital.&nbsp; For this very reason, Chaa Creek, an eco lodge situated only 2 hours by road from Tikal is an excellent location for both a
									jungle and archeological experience. As part of their Inland Expeditions tour series, guests can arrange in advance or on the spot a full day
									excursion to Tikal including transportation, entry fee, monument guide and lunch.
								</p>
								<p class="para">
									Garnering the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) Environmental Award for 2001, Chaa Creek is striving to preserve the native
									habitat.&nbsp; In the early 1980's Mick and Lucy Fleming ( a Brit and an American) purchased&nbsp;acreage west of San Ignacio.&nbsp; In the
									ensuing years they have transformed their property into a premier eco lodge.&nbsp; The accommodations are the traditional Mayan style which
									remains the&nbsp;design of choice in contemporary villages.
								</p>
								<p class="para">
									Utilizing&nbsp; ancient&nbsp;materials&nbsp;each&nbsp;cottage is constructed with white washed&nbsp; adobe blocks.&nbsp; The&nbsp; roof is
									thatched from the locally grown cohune (bay leaf)&nbsp;palm leaves. The Flemings are investigating ways to grow this endangered palm and thus
									maintain the traditional&nbsp;thatching supply.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each cottage's electricity is generated from a central source.&nbsp; Although Chaa
									Creek is&nbsp;striving for authenticity, its guests are relieved to find that proper beds with comfy mattresses have replaced traditional
									hammocks and that en suite bathrooms complete with sinks, showers and flush toilets have replaced the outhouse.&nbsp; All rooms are tastefully
									decorated with colorful Mayan textiles and Spanish influenced &nbsp;wood furniture, all hand crafted in neighboring Guatemala. Each
									cottage's&nbsp;veranda is equipped with a hammock and the &quot;regulation&quot; lime green gecko. The grounds are
									predominately&nbsp;landscaped with native species, but humble zinnias are interspersed amongst the exotic heliconia.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the years Mick and Lucy have slowly &quot;developed&quot; the property.&nbsp; Catering to the outdoor set, they offer&nbsp; more rustic
									accommodations at the Macal River Camp which is popular site for launching canoe trips.&nbsp;Hiking/mountain bike&nbsp;trails galore wend
									throughout the property.&nbsp;From Chaa Creek, an equestrian trail leads to&nbsp;the popular Cahal Pech&nbsp;Mayan ruin circuit.&nbsp; Nature
									lovers will enjoy the crack of &nbsp;dawn bird watching&nbsp;walks&nbsp;or hiking&nbsp; up the hill to the Natural History Centre and the
									Butterfly Farm.&nbsp; The farm has a fascinating display on the life cycle of the morpho butterfly. These iridescent blue butterflies are
									raised here for export to United States and other countries.&nbsp; For the weary bodies, Chaa Creek's latest addition,&nbsp;the spa on
									Butterfly Hill, offers state of the art facilities with a panoramic view of the surrounding rain forest.&nbsp;,
								</p>
								<p>
									In the grand scheme, Mick and Lucy want to recreate a working Mayan settlement where local farmers and their families can live and work the
									land as their ancestors have done for over a 1000 years. The Flemings are dedicated to preserving not only endangered species, but also
									endangered cultures.&nbsp;

									The adventurous&nbsp;should seek out&nbsp;the popular day trips&nbsp;to the Chumpaiate Cave or the Branch Crystal Cave. In preparation for the
									day's outing guests are asked bring a bathing suit and aqua or tennis shoes for the cave swimming/fording that is part of the cave
									exploration.&nbsp; Pine Ridge is aptly named for its pine forests and a deviation to Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Blancaneaux&quot; Lodge is
									an&nbsp;incongruous diversion in this remote &nbsp;&quot;alpine&quot; setting.

									The allure of the Belizean&nbsp;tropical reefs frequently overshadows Belize's interior, but the visitor should not overlook this fascinating
									area and its rich heritage.&nbsp; The perfect combination for any vacation to Belize should include both the jungle and the beach!
