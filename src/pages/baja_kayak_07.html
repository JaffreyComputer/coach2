				at the hotel between 7am-8am. Please have your expedition gear organized, packed and separated from your travel clothes (which you will be leaving
				behind at the hotel). Once we’re all ready we will board our shuttle Van for a short transfer just north of La Paz to where our speedboat awaits. We
				will then board the boat for an exhilarating ride across Canal De San Lorenzo to one of two base camps on Isla Del Espiritu Santo (Holy Spirit Island).
				17km long Isla Espiritu Santos western shoreline features 13 bays, idyllic sand beaches and some of the finest snorkeling and fishing in the area.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
				We will walk off the boat into a pre-established base camp, at which point we will have a camp orientation, lunch and a thorough orientation to safe sea
				kayak practices and deep-water rescues. The remainder of the day will be spent snorkeling and exploring the local waters, and/or hiking.

				will head off for a day of exploration. Due to the nature of the prevailing winds we will be on the water early to make the most of the day. Lunch will
				be served at a secluded beach and we will find ourselves back at base camp by early afternoon with plenty of time to siesta, relax, snorkel, fish and
				explore.

				As we paddle north the seascape changes substantially. Lunch will be served at the narrow isthmus separating Isla Del Espiritu Santo from Isla la
				Partida, where there is an excellent snorkeling spot and sea caves nearby to explore.

				We find ourselves by mid-afternoon paddling into Ensenada Grande, a large bay which is more than one mile deep. One of Ensenada's inviting sand beaches

				before gathering our personal gear and getting organized for the return shuttle ride across the San Lorenzo Channel. We arrive in La Paz by mid-late
				afternoon in time to relax, freshen up and prepare for our last evening together. We will meet for cocktails around 7pm and head out for dinner and
