			<p class="para">
				For sixteen years, <a href="tn_profiles.html"> Christina Wilson</a> has brought women together to experience culturally enriching, adventure oriented
				trips around the world. The spirit of sisterhood and community service are an integral part of every tour. Women are encouraged to &quot;try their
				wings&quot; in safe, yet sometimes physically and emotionally challenging ways along the journey. To foster this end, groups are limited to no more than
				twelve women. Participants are invited to contribute to the group journal, photo/slide album and <a href="world_citizens.html">Service Project</a>.
				Christina firmly believes in giving back to the local communities she visits whether it be schools supplies to an elementary school in Baja California,
				quilts for a boys' orphanage in Katmandu, Nepal or medical supplies for a local clinic in Cuzco, Peru.
