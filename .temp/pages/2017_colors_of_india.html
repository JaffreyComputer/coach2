        <strong><em>A Women&rsquo;s Tour with </em></strong><strong><em>Christina Wilson and Wendy Lama</em></strong><strong></strong><br />
        <strong><em>January 9-24, 2017 </em></strong></h1>
      <p ></p>
      <p class="para"><strong><img src="../assets/images/1.png" alt="" width="381" height="289" class="img_right" />South India</strong> is a marvel of senses, a multiplicity of cultures, a collage of landscapes, and a menagerie of wildlife, legends and deities that has drawn travelers since the dawn of South Asian civilizations, some <strong>4000 years ago</strong>. On this trip, we&rsquo;ll visit some of the classic must sees – the <strong>famous rock temples</strong> of Mahabalipuram, the <strong>architectural wonders </strong>of Madurai said to nearly rival the Taj Mahal, and the <strong>classical dance, music and arts </strong>of Kochi and Chennai; we&rsquo;ll float down the quiet waterways of <strong>Kerala&rsquo;s backwaters</strong> where life passes at the pace of a floating leaf, visit a <strong>homestay family</strong> at riverside, overnight on a houseboat and track wildlife at <strong>Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary</strong>.</p>
      <p class="para"><img src="../assets/images/2.png" alt="" width="352" height="226" class="img_right" />Your itinerary has been planned to give you a taste of South India&rsquo;s ancient cultures, arts, and history – as well as colorful spice, flower, vegetable and textile bazaars, the heart of urban life -- at a <strong>relaxing pace</strong> that allows you to discover some of your own treasures in this rich tapestry of life. We&rsquo;ll spend <strong>two to three nights at most destinations</strong>. We&rsquo;ll also <strong>spend time with local women</strong>:  joining village women in the kitchen at Pongal Festival in Madurai and with our home-stay hostesses in Kumarakom. We&rsquo;ll go back stage at cultural dance performances and visit a <strong>social service project</strong> site where our contributions can help <strong>uplift disadvantaged women</strong>. We&rsquo;ll seek out women leaders with whom we&rsquo;ll gain insight into a woman&rsquo;s world in India.</p>
      <p class="para"><img src="../assets/images/3.png" alt="" width="391" height="256" class="img_right" />Please join<strong> Wendy Brewer Lama and Christina Wilson </strong>on a continuing series of women&rsquo;s travel experiences in Asia. Women-to-women, we seek to build friendships across the world, and to nurture a sense of comradery and ease among our returning and new trip members. </p>

        Chennai and Cochin and the coastal areas to their south will be in mid to high 80s to low 90s during the daytime and mid-60s and 70s at night. In Madurai expect daytime temperatures in the low 70s to 80s, cooler at night. It will be cooler (high 40s to low-60s) in the highlands (Thekkady).  </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Single Supplements</strong><br />
        On this trip, unlike on past Christina Wilson-KarmaQuest-Terra Nova trips, we will not include a &ldquo;rotating single&rdquo; room which allowed someone to occasionally have a single room (on rotation, or on special request due to illness, etc.). We have found that people prefer to have the same roommate, or have a single room throughout the entire trip. Single accommodations can be requested by those who wish to room alone, and will be subject to availability at the time of booking. The single supplement charge reflects the prices that Indian hotels charge for occupying a single room vs sharing a room. If you wish to share a room and do not have a travel companion with whom to share, we will inform you of others among the group members who also wish to share a room and invite you to contact them. If you choose not to or are unable to share, you will be responsible for the single supplement charge. </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Accommodations, Travel Conditions, Services and Expectations</strong><br />
        Hotels chosen are generally equivalent to three to four+ star standard (within India&rsquo;s hotel standard rating system). Several are of the excellent Taj hotel line in India. Others are smaller and lovely boutique or heritage hotels. Homestay facilities are villa style (separate buildings from the family home), and the houseboat is deluxe with air conditioning. All are selected to provide you a very comfortable and safe environment that reflects India&rsquo;s unique cultural flavour as well as for their optimal locations. Occasionally, due to circumstances beyond our control, the selected hotel or the preferred room standard is not available.  Every effort will be made to provide the utmost level of comfort and satisfaction at all times. </p>
      <p class="para">In general the check-in and check-out times at all hotels, unless otherwise stated in this itinerary, is between 1200 noon and 1400 hours. Whenever possible, we will arrange for suitable locations for rest and respite should flight schedules and the itinerary require otherwise. </p>
      <p class="para">Roads travelled on this trip are generally paved and well maintained. Some overland travel in rural settings may be on unpaved roads. Travel to and from Periyar involves some curvy hillside roads. All roads are subject to construction or other interruptions. </p>
      <p class="para">Your safety and comfort are our utmost priority. Travelers will likely be pleasantly surprised at the level of hospitality afforded. We encourage you to maintain a spirit of adventure and readiness for unanticipated opportunities and change of plans. Our follow-up pre-departure information will provide additional tips for traveling, packing, and knowing what to expect. <br />

  <strong>Social Service Program</strong><br />
        In keeping with the tradition of supporting social services in the countries we visit, this trip will feature the opportunity for trip members to visit and contribute to a social service program in India. We will provide additional information about the program and how we can contribute at a later time. </p>
