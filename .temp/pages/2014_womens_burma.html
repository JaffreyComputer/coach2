        <strong><em>November 3 - 19, 2014</em></strong></h2>
      <p class="para"><strong><img src="2014%20burma%20images/image1.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="154" hspace="12" align="left" class="img_right" />Terra Nova Travel </strong>is pleased to present another <strong>KarmaQuest trip </strong>specially designed for<strong> Christina Wilson</strong> and friends. Please join<strong> Christina </strong>and <strong>Wendy Brewer Lama</strong>, Director and Ecotourism Specialist of <strong>KarmaQuest Ecotourism and Adventure Travel</strong> on this third in a series of women&rsquo;s trips to Asia&rsquo;s centers of hand-produced textiles and centuries-old bazaars.</p>
      <p class="para">With a small group of women textile arts and crafts enthusiasts, we&rsquo;ll venture off the beaten track to <strong>village settings</strong> and <strong>artisan workshops</strong> to learn about Burma&rsquo;s age-old methods of hand-loom, silk and lotus root weaving <strong>with arts and crafts experts</strong>.  We&rsquo;ll attend quiet monasteries, tour magnificent ancient capital and temple sites – crowned as <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</strong> – and travel by air, ground and water to see the colorful and undiscovered cultural landscapes of Burma.</p>
      <p class="para"><img src="images/clip_image007.gif" alt="" width="202" height="153" hspace="12" align="right" class="img_right" />South East Asian textiles are known for their beauty and intricacy. <strong>Design and production methods in Burma have been influenced by over 2000 years of cultural and trade relationships</strong> with neighboring India and South East Asian countries. Traditionally, these intricate textiles have been made on a back-tension (back strap) loom with homegrown cotton, flax or hemp, often dyed with indigo or other locally produced natural dyes. They served as clothing and badges of identity and status -- cultural markers that are little known to the outside world. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="para">Weaving as a cottage industry plays an important part in the economy and life of many Burmese and ethnic families. Our attention to the textiles and their producers brings not only pleasure to us but encourages and gives status to the weavers who uphold these traditions.  In the tradition of past women&rsquo;s trips, we&rsquo;ll research and select a worthy <strong>Social Service Project </strong>to visit and support through our donations, purchases and contacts. <br />

      <p class="para">Embark on a walking tour of China town, street market, Pansodan Street, Botataung Pagoda, Wahdan jetty; then to the <strong>National Museum</strong> for a short introduction to the ethnic peoples of Burma.  Later in the day: visit the shop and private collection of Dwa Khun Shwe (<em>photo left)</em>, expert on Chin textiles.  Enjoy a welcome dinner of traditional Burmese food.

      <p class="sectionhdr"><strong>Day 5 / November 7  -- <strong>Inle Lake: living on the water.</strong></strong></p>
      <p class="para"><img src="images/clip_image031.gif" alt="" width="143" height="178" hspace="12" align="right" class="img_right" />Fly to Heho and drive one hour to Inle Lake. Set amidst a ring of hills, at 2950 feet above sea level, this elongated lake (35 miles by 19 miles) is the home of a unique lifestyle of living in <strong>stilted homes</strong> and fishing, farming and traveling by boat to market. Our stay will mimic this: <strong>our accommodations for three nights are over the water!</strong> We&rsquo;ll <strong>travel primarily by boat</strong> for the next few days. Today we&rsquo;ll visit <strong>Phaungdaw U Pagoda</strong>, containing a set of five important relics to which people pray and reportedly their prayers come true. We&rsquo;ll also visit <strong>Ngaphae Chaung Monastery</strong>, previously knows as &ldquo;jumping cat monastery&rdquo; for the large number of resident cats. This typical Shan style wooden monastery was built on stilts and contains lovely statues of the Buddha. <strong> </strong>We will continue on to Innpawkhone<strong> Village</strong> where we can see lotus and silk weaving industries and also ikat patterned silk longyi. The <strong>lotus blossom root </strong>produces strands that are woven into shawls and look much like natural colored linen. Then to a village that weaves cotton longyis (sarongs) using <strong>harness floor looms</strong> and return to our lakeside terrace to watch the sun set into the hills. <strong> </strong>Overnight at Inle Lake.  <strong>(B/L/-)</strong>      </p>

      <p class="para"><img src="images/clip_image029.gif" alt="" width="183" height="139" hspace="12" align="left" class="img_right" />Today we&rsquo;ll visit the highly revered <strong>Mahamuni Pagoda,</strong> the holiest site in Mandalay where the devout perform daily washing of the millennia-old image of Buddha. We&rsquo;ll stop by a gold leaf hammering craft shop to see how the gold leaf temple offerings are made. Next, we&rsquo;ll visit the ancient royal capital of <strong>Amarapura</strong>, where we&rsquo;ll visit <strong>Mahagandayon monastery</strong>, a school for young monks and give alms to the Buddhist practitioners. Nearby stands the famous <strong>U Bein Bridge</strong>, built more than two centuries ago and at nearly 2 miles in length, the longest teakwood span in the world. Later, we&rsquo;ll visit <strong>Inwa,</strong>founded in 1364 as a royal capital and lasting nearly 400 years. Highlights include the ' leaning tower of Ava', a brick-and-stucco monastery, and an elegant teakwood monastery. Overnight, Mandalay.    <strong>(B/L/-)</strong><br clear="all" />

      <p class="para"><img src="2014%20burma%20images/image3.png" alt="" width="186" height="141" class="img_right" />Riding the Irrawaddy river from Mandalay to Bagan as so many early travellers and trades men did, we&rsquo;ll board our boutique cruise ship at the Sagaing jetty and glide all day down this still-active commercial, travel and fishing corridor. In the late afternoon, we&rsquo;ll stop at Yandabo, the village where the peace treaty of the First Anglo-Burmese war was signed in 1826. The first of three wars fought between the British and Burmese Empire in the 19th century, it was also the longest and most expensive war in British Indian history. Fifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died in what became the beginning of the end of Burmese independence at the time. Today Yandabo is known for its pottery making; pots are floated down river by boat and sold from the riverbanks (<em>photo above). </em> We&rsquo;ll moor overnight near the village of Shwe Nann Tint. Lunch and dinner on board.               <strong>(B/L/D)</strong>      </p>

We&rsquo;ll continue on to Mt. Popa, a volcanic plug that rises majestically and almost magically above the plains – thus the reverence paid to it and the monastery and shrines that sit at its top. Besides Buddhist temples, it is home to some of Burma&rsquo;s whimsical <strong><em>nats</em></strong> or spirits to which people often pray for specific requests. Time permitting, we&rsquo;ll walk to the top of the plug alongside local pilgrims and scores of feisty monkeys. Overnight at Popa Mountain Resort.    <strong>(B/L/-)</strong><br />

Sprawling across a vast plain lie some 2,500 clay and stone stupas (temples) and pagodas of all sizes and shapes. Many were commissioned by early rulers seeking merit and to outdo each other with artistic splendor. We&rsquo;ll see examples of the various styles and materials, and will go inside to see magnificent <strong>golden statues, frescoes and impressive stone arch supports</strong>. Bagan is also known for superb <strong>lacquer-ware</strong>, delicately painted with single horse-hair brushes; we&rsquo;ll visit a lacquer workshop and shop.

    </p>
      <p class="sectionhdr"><strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
      <p class="para">A chance of a lifetime:  take an early morning hot air balloon ride over Bagan for an amazing view of this vast templescape from above.

      Travel conditions in Burma have improved remarkably in recent years. Airport facilities, roads and air service, hotels and sightseeing venues in the main tourist sites are now approaching standards found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. </p>
      <p class="para">We have selected generally three and four star standard hotel accommodations to provide you a very comfortable environment that reflects Burma&rsquo;s unique culture flavour as well as for their varied and optimal locations. Occasionally, due to circumstances beyond our control, the selected hotel or the preferred room standard is not available.  Every effort will be made to provide the utmost level of comfort and satisfaction at all times. </p>
      <p class="para">Some textile and crafts-production sites require overland travel in rural settings, where road conditions are generally good but always subject to construction or other interruptions. </p>
      <p class="para">None-the-less, Burma is very much a developing country with a young tourism industry. Service staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating, and will surely capture your heart. Travelers will be pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort afforded while maintaining a spirit of adventure and readiness for unanticipated opportunities and change of plans. Our follow-up pre-departure information will provide additional tips for traveling, packing, and knowing what to expect.  </p>

      <p class="para"><strong>Travelling in Burma</strong><br />
      <strong><em>What to call it? </em></strong><br />
      The ruling military junta changed the country&rsquo;s name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989. The United Nations recognized the change, but initially the US and UK did not. Successive U.S. governments have refused to acknowledge the name change. The United States for years deliberately referred to the nation of 60 million people as Burma, so as not to give legitimacy to military governments.<br />
      But in a nod to political reforms made by President Thein Sein, the White House acknowledged it is now employing the name Myanmar more often than before. (Reuters, May 20, 2013) <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/20/us-usa-myanmar-name-idUSBRE94J0YT20130520">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/20/us-usa-myanmar-name-idUSBRE94J0YT20130520</a></p>

      <p class="para"><strong><em>The ethics of traveling to Burma</em></strong><br />
      Over the past fifteen years, travelers have debated the ethics of visiting Burma.  Some have boycotted travel to Burma, suggesting that tourism unduly benefits the military government and its cronies. Others see the value of bringing tourism-related jobs to local populations and enabling two-way communications with the outside world.  </p>
      <p class="para">In 2011, the National League for Democracy (NLD), Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s party which supports restoration of democracy and human rights in Burma, issued a public statement that &ldquo;visitors were once again welcome – so long as they eschewed large-scale package tours in favor of gaining &lsquo;an insight into the cultural, political and social life of the country while enjoying a happy and fulfilling <br />
      holiday in Burma.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.nldburma.org/media-press-release/press-release/316-nld-statement-no-100511-released-on-20th-may-2011-regarding-tourism-in-burma-.html">http://www.nldburma.org/media-press-release/press-release/316-nld-statement-no-100511-released-on-20th-may-2011-regarding-tourism-in-burma-.html</a>). </p>
      <p class="para">KarmaQuest&rsquo;s long standing commitment to the ethics of ecotourism supports the generation of equitable economic and educational opportunities to local populations, as well as conservation of the natural environment and cultural heritage of places we visit. In Burma, we select in-country travel partners and hotels that are not affiliated with the government, military or associates of either.  </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="para"><strong><em>Travel Security </em></strong><br />
      Each year, thousands of U.S. citizens travel to Burma for tourism, to visit family, and for other reasons. The U.S. Department of State has no travel warnings for Burma. Crime rates are lower in Burma than in many other countries in the region. Violent crime against foreigners is rare.</p>
      <p class="para">Burma&rsquo;s political climate occasionally erupts into localized conflicts between the government and ethnic minority groups along the country&rsquo;s border regions. We will closely follow media reports and public information about the security situation in Burma before and during our travels. Additional information regarding wise travel practices in Burma will be included in the Pre-Departure Information packet, distributed when you book the trip. </p>
      <p class="para">Please see the following website for additional information. <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1077.html">http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1077.html</a></p>
      <p class="para"><strong><em>Health Issues</em></strong><br />
      Regarding health safety:  medical facilities and personnel training in Burma are inadequate.  We require that you have medevac insurance in case you need to be transported to a regional medical center outside of Burma for emergency care. We will provide additional information on medevac insurance once you sign up for the trip. We will also provide information on vaccinations and other health precautions via the CDC website and in our Pre-Departure Information.</p>

      <p class="para">Christina worked with Outward Bound for many years and it was there, putting women&rsquo;s trips together, that she found her passion.

The trips she puts together always include a service project or a contribution to a local organization. </p>
      <p class="para">Christina has led many trips all over the world. Her trips are usually small so that the group travels intimately and easily. For the last twenty years she has led many groups to interesting places, including Peru. Bolivia, Ecuador, Italy, England, Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, Burma, Micronesia, Bali, and Indonesia, to name a few.&nbsp; Her most recent&nbsp;trips, operated by KarmaQuest,&nbsp;are with a small group&nbsp;of women&nbsp;who toured&nbsp;Laos and Vietnam in&nbsp;February 2009, and India in January 2011. Christina&nbsp;is a National Tropical Botanical Gardens member and is currently on the Board of Trustees. She&nbsp;led&nbsp;her third trip for NTBG in November 2008 to Madagascar and South Africa&nbsp;and has&nbsp;recently returned from the NTBG-sponsored Amazon cruise&nbsp;led by NTBG&nbsp;Fellow and former head of Kew Gardens, Sir Ghilliean Prance.</p>
